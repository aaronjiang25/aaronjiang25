Hello, everyone, my name is Aaron Jiang!

### Who am I? 
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am honing my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science. As an aspiring software engineer with an interest in cybersecurity, my goal is to contribute to the fortification of our digital world. My academic and personal projects have allowed me to develop a solid foundation in programming languages such as C/C++ and Python. Beyond these, I am actively expanding my skill set to include web development technologies, specifically CSS, HTML, and Javascript, to ensure a well-rounded expertise. This journey into web development complements my cybersecurity interests, as understanding the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications is crucial for securing them. Outside of my technical pursuits, I am passionate about engaging with the tech community through hackathons and conferences, constantly seeking new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and abilities.

Languages: C/C++ and Python, CSS, HTML
